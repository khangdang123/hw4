TWO USES:
1)	Code Reusability: Inheritance is a technique that allow a class to derive or inherit properties from another class. Suppose we have a parent class with two properties, and we want to create another class (child class) that inherits these properties. In this case, we can utilize Inheritance to acquire those properties because the parent class can be directly used by the child class. The advantage of employing inheritance is that you avoid rewrite code when a class requires properties from another class.
2)	Creating specialized Classes: Inheritance allows us to establish specialized classes that extend upon the properties of a parent class. By creating a child class that inherits certain properties from the parent class and incorporates its own unique features, we can build a more specialized class.
